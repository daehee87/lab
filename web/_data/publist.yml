  image: badaslr.png
  description: Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) is de-facto standard exploit mitigation technique. Ironically, although exceptional,there are rare edge cases where ASLR becomes handy for memory exploitation. This research dig into such theoretical set of cases and name it as BadASLR.

- title: "On the Analysis of Byte-Granularity Heap Randomization"
  image: ruma.png
  description: Modern heap exploits often abuse the determinism in word alignment, and modern CPU architecture better supports unaligned access (since Nehalem). Based on such new developments, this research conducts an in-depth analysis of evaluating the efficacy of byte-granularity heap randomization.
